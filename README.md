# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

### Overview

This project is aimed at analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program in order to help the client glean information on whether adopting a similar program would be beneficial.  The data reviewed for this analysis was Amazon reviews in the US on books purchased.  The client requested three questions to be answered, as listed below under **Results**.


## Results

* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

Out of 403,807 total reviews, not only weren't there any Vine (paid) reviews with 5 stars, there doesn't appear to have been any helpful Vine reviews at all as seen below.

Subsequently, that means that all reviews were non-Vine, or unpaid reviews.

* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

Of those reviews, there were 242,889 5-star reviews, about 60% of the total overall.

## Summary

As far as book products go, this research difinitely shows that the paid program has no real benefit for the client to adopt, and with such high numbers of 5-star reviews, being paid to review or not doesn't seem to hold much sway in the positivity of the review.  I believe that another analysis with different products would be required to see if there's a difference between goods provided, which would create a better target for the client in whom to offer the program to.
